# BitBar Plugins

This repo contains scripts, programs and command-line tools that add functionality to [BitBar](https://github.com/stretchr/bitbar#get-started).

### How to use them

  * Just drop the plugin into your BitBar plugins folder
  * Make sure it's executable (in Terminal, do `chmod +x plugin.sh`)
  * Then choose `Reset` from the BitBar menus

### Write your own

We're always looking for new plugins, so please send us pull requests if you write anything cool or useful.

### Got ideas?

If you've got ideas, or want to report a bug, nip over to our [issues page](https://github.com/stretchr/bitbar/issues) and let us know.
